How to play:

The build was too large to store on git. If you want to use a build instead of the settings in Unity create a build with the scenes in this order.
Main  Menu
Level1
Level2
Level3

and then run that build. Otherwise you can just use the unity editor to run the game.


WASD or arrow keys to move.



KNOWN BUGS:

In level 2 and 3 the multiple lanes spawn correctly for wave 1, but for all future waves they only spawn on the last wave.

When you hit an enemy or collide with them incorrectly sometimes they fly away with a ton of speed. If they happen to fall off the map the wave becomes unbeatable and you have to restart the game, most prominent on Level1.
